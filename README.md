# Sustainable Smart Surveillance with Motion‑Based Video Optimization
Our project is an AI‑powered smart surveillance system designed to improve the efficiency and sustainability of CCTV storage and monitoring. Traditional CCTV systems continuously record and store large amounts of static footage, resulting in excessive storage consumption, increased energy usage, and unnecessary hardware wear. Our system uses computer vision and machine learning techniques such as background subtraction and motion detection to identify meaningful events and automatically extract only the relevant video segments. By eliminating redundant static footage and preserving only motion‑based events with accurate timestamps, the system significantly reduces storage requirements and optimizes resource utilization. This contributes to sustainable smart living by lowering energy consumption, extending hardware lifespan, and enabling intelligent, automated surveillance for modern homes and infrastructure.
